# Code Portfolio

This repository is a curated collection of code and projects I developed during and after my PhD at the University of Wisconsinâ€“Madison.

It includes learning exercises, side projects, and research scripts spanning multiple projects. This repository serves as a portfolio of my coding experience and ongoing exploration of data science and analytical methods in cancer research. It is actively maintained and regularly updated to reflect ongoing work.

**Note: Some scripts developed during my PhD are still being finalized and will be added over time.**

## Contents

The repository includes scripts, notebooks, and supporting materials used for:

- Data/image analysis, quantification, and visualization
- RNA-seq data processing and analysis
- Workflow automation
- Figure generation for publications
- Side projects and exploratory code

## Notes
- The code is provided as-is to showcase my programming experience.
- Certain project-specific data and proprietary materials have been excluded due to privacy and data-sharing restrictions.
