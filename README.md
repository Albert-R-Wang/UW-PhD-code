# UW-PhD-code

This repository contains a curated collection of code developed during my PhD studies at the University of Wisconsinâ€“Madison.

The code spans multiple projects, analyses, and exploratory work conducted throughout my doctoral research, primarily in the area of cancer research. It is shared here as a portfolio of my coding experience. 
**Some scripts are still being finalized and will be added over time.**

## Contents

The repository includes scripts, notebooks, and supporting materials used for:

- Data/image analysis, quantification, and visualization
