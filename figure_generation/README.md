# Figure Generation Scripts

This directory contains R scripts used to generate various types of visualizations for exploratory analysis, result interpretation, and publication-quality figures. Each script in this folder is modular and focused on a specific type of figure or analysis output.

## Contents

- `VennDiagram.R`: Generates Venn diagrams for comparing differentially expressed genes (DEGs) or enriched gene ontology (GO) terms across multiple conditions.
- `DEG_comparison_4quadrant_scatter_plot.R`: Generates a 4-quadrant scatter plot to compare gene expression across two differential expression analyses.
- `BubblePlot_enrichment.R`: Generates a bubble plot to visualize enrichment results, with bubble size representing % DEGs and color indicating adjusted p-values.
- More will be added overtime
