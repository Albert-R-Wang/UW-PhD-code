# RNA-seq Analysis

This folder contains code and scripts used for analyzing RNA-seq data during my PhD research at the University of Wisconsinâ€“Madison.

The workflows included here were developed and refined across multiple projects involving bulk RNA-seq data, with a focus on data processing, differential expression analysis, visualization, and downstream biological interpretation.

## Contents

- Data preprocessing
- Differential gene expression analysis (DESeq2)
- Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA)
- Functional annotation (GO/KEGG enrichment)
- Data visualization (heatmaps, volcano plots, PCA, clustering)
- Integration with external datasets (e.g., TCGA)

## Notes

- The code is provided as-is for reference and educational purposes.
- Project-specific data and raw input files are not included due to privacy and data sharing restrictions.
- Example scripts and templates are included to demonstrate key analysis steps.
